        <div style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 25px;">Hey there,</div>
        <div style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 24px;"><br /> First of all, we would like to thank you for choosing to become a part of The Blockchain University community. <br /><br /> We built this platform to solve the biggest hurdle we faced. Over the years, we had learnt more about computers and software building products, running companies and learning online; but none of the employers would hire us unless we spent thousands of dollars again and got that stamped on a college degree! <br /><br /> But now, with The Blockchain University, our learning from informal sources can be recognized just as much as college degrees... <br /><br /> <b>If you are a teacher</b>,
            <ol>
                <li>You now have a wallet for GYAN and KARMA.</li>
                <li>Every time you teach something, give it recognition by publishing its rules and knowledge value <b>('GYAN')</b> on a global ledger.</li>
                <li>When you are done teaching, publish your student's assessment on the same ledger.</li>
                <li>After a week, you will be rewarded for your effort with <b>('KARMA')</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <br /><br /> <b>If you are a student</b>,
            <ol>
                <li>You now have a wallet for GYAN and KARMA.</li>
                <li>Every time you learn something, get recognition for it by participating in its globally published teaching contract.</li>
                <li>As soon as your teacher publishes your assessment, your <b>('GYAN')</b> balance goes up.</li>
                <li>After a week, you will be rewarded for your effort with <b>('KARMA')</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <br /><br /> Every learning activity is now a <b>degree</b> <br /> - issued and accredited by your teacher <br /> - owned by you <br /> - and verifiable by everyone.</div>
